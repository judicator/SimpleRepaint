0.4.2
-----
* Added three drills from MKS mod to greylist.
* Added blacklist for Kerbal Atomics, added reactors and RTGs from dev version of Near Future Electrical to blacklist.
* Moved greylist to separate GreyList.cfg file.
* Bundled B9PartSwitch updated to last version (2.20.0).
* Mod is marked as 1.12.5 compatible.

0.4.1
-----
* Added some parts from VaporVent mod to greylist.
* Added blacklist for Bluedog_DB mod (about 600 parts are blacklisted from more than a thousand total in BDB).
* Mod is marked as 1.12.4 compatible.

0.4.0
-----
* Changed MM patch order to get rid of problems, caused by interaction with other mods' patches, updating B9PS switchers (i.e. Kerbalism + SSPX).
* Black and grey lists are now moved to separate folder (IgnoreParts). List of blacklisted parts is expanded, parts from several mods added.

0.3.3
-----
* Added some unsupported parts to blacklist (thanks to @Hohmannson).
* Marked as KPS 1.12.3 compatible.

0.3.2
-----
* Made compability patch for BDArmory guns more universal, which hopefully will improve support for BDA-based parts mods in the future.
* Several parts from Aviator Arsenal Continued mod added to greylist.

0.3.1
-----
+ Added setting to use whitelist-only repainting (disabled by default, see readme).

0.3.0
-----
* Rearranged colors list, added new colors.
+ Parts incompatible with B9PartSwitch are added to grey list. So far three stock parts and several parts from BDArmory and MiningExpansion are greylisted.
+ Greylisted parts will still get repaint ability with stock Part Variants interface, added setting to disable this behavior (enabled by default).

0.2.1
-----
+ Added ability to repaint parts in flight and setting to disable this behavior (enabled by default).

0.2.0
-----
* Fixed fatal bug: kerbals going on EVA gone missing, some parts of the vessel explode, B9PS error pop ups. Apparently having any B9PartSwitch module on kerbals themselves (KerbalEVA* parts) is a really bad idea.

0.1.0
-----
- Initial version with universal patch, using B9PartSwitch to choose part color.

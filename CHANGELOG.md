0.2.1
-----
+ Added ability to repaint parts in flight and setting to disable this behavior (enabled by default).

0.2.0
-----
* Fixed fatal bug: kerbals going on EVA gone missing, some parts of the vessel explode, B9PS error pop ups. Apparently having any B9PartSwitch module on kerbals themselves (KerbalEVA* parts) is a really bad idea.

0.1.0
-----
- Initial version with universal patch, using B9PartSwitch to choose part color.
